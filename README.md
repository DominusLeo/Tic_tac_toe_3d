## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Tic_tac_toe_3d
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies
- `matplotlib`: 3D visualization and plotting
- `numpy`: Mathematical operations and array handling
- `pandas`: Data analysis and statistics
- `sympy`: Geometric calculations
- `tqdm`: Progress bars
- `seaborn`: Statistical visualizations

## Configuration

### Game Settings
Edit `constants.py` to customize game behavior:

```python
class Configs:
    GRAVITY = True          # Enable/disable gravity physics
    SHAPE = 4              # Board size (4x4x4 recommended)
    play_vs_bot = 1        # 0=Human vs Human, 1=Human vs Bot, 2=Bot vs Human
    bot_difficult = 4      # Bot difficulty (1-5)
    second_bot = 0         # Second bot difficulty (for Bot vs Bot)
    debug_mod = False      # Enable debug mode
```

### Visual Settings
- **Colors**: Customize player colors in `stack` dictionary
- **Transparency**: Adjust 3D visualization opacity
- **Sizing**: Configure piece sizes and board dimensions

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
```bash
python game_process.py
```

### Game Controls
- **Make a move**: Enter coordinates in format `xyz` (e.g., `123` for position x=1, y=2, z=3)
- **Exit game**: Type `ex`
- **Cancel last two turns**: Type `c` (undoes both your move and opponent's move)
- **Follow hints**: The game provides guidance in the terminal

### Coordinate System
- **X-axis**: Left to right (1-4)
- **Y-axis**: Front to back (1-4)  
- **Z-axis**: Bottom to top (1-4)
- **Example**: `234` places a piece at position (2, 3, 4)

### Winning Conditions
Connect 4 pieces in a line in any direction:
- **Horizontal**: Same Z-level, straight line
- **Vertical**: Same X,Y coordinates, different Z-levels
- **Diagonal**: Diagonal lines within planes or across 3D space
- **3D Diagonals**: Corner-to-corner through the cube

Enable debug mode in `constants.py` for automated testing and analysis.

## Tips for Players

### Strategy Basics
1. **Control the Center**: Center positions offer more winning lines
2. **Watch for Forks**: Look for opportunities to create multiple threats
3. **Block Opponent**: Always block immediate winning threats
4. **Think 3D**: Consider all planes and diagonal possibilities
5. **Use Gravity**: When enabled, plan your moves considering piece physics

### Advanced Tactics
- **Dead Point Control**: Secure strategically important positions early
- **Fork Creation**: Set up multiple winning threats simultaneously
- **Vertical Strategy**: Use the Z-axis for unexpected attacks
- **Corner Control**: Corner positions can be powerful in 3D space
